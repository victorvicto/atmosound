- DONE? use on('end') and getSoundUrls to pick a random sound to play next (if same and urls.length>1 -> get next url)
- setup system for seemless loop for longer sounds (a "bend time" in seconds that says how long the blend should be (0 blend time is no blend))
- Add info tooltips for everything
- Find other way than volume multiplier to normaise all sounds or find a way to make it work (volume multiplier commented for now)
- make sure every function got adapted to the arrival of weathers and moods (ex: change sound)
- make sure that audio is updated on every click (especially weather change)
- utiliser sound_list pour mood? (avec premier sound qui correspond aux circonstances qui joue)
- use frontend alternative to ytdl-core (youtube to mp3 api, play api?, avoid it all together?)
- Make promptEdit give suggestions and only allow suggestions (10 min)
- make one sound-pack per biome? (automatically remove biome from other soundpack when biome activated on new soundpack)(if a biome is not activated in any soundpack, that biome doesn't play anything for that sound)
- Solve why sound stops if running when switching day time
- make sounds trimmable (4h)
- make biomes weather probability (markhov chain?)
- make auto weather button that, when activated, changes the weather everytime the timeofday changes (and less likely change when place changes?)
- change Icon (10min)
- add wind intensity for weather (and minimal wind intensity to sounds in place soundlist)
- solving glitch problem
- solve all sounds problem
- add transition sound (with "transition" button)
- clean everything by making classes instead of everything in one big dictionary
