- Make a single function for creating howls and add a gain node there
- include stereo options in sound
- create homemade audio preview in soundlist that allows trimming and that plays api urls as well
- Add images for places (and moods?) the place images each have checks for each biome (like for sounds)
- Add info tooltips for everything
- When a transition happens, try to fade from low lowpass filter to high lowpass filter instead of progressively increasing lowpass (requires a new copy of sound and syncing the copy with original (not sure if possible))
- better below (secretly divide volume_mul by two (a 1 actually means 0.5, and is the default) that way sounds can be made "louder")
- make all howls go through a gain filter that has a gain equal to the sound's volume_mul
- make sure every function got adapted to the arrival of weathers and moods (ex: change sound)
- make sure that audio is updated on every click (especially weather change)
- utiliser sound_list pour mood? (avec premier sound qui correspond aux circonstances qui joue)
- use frontend alternative to ytdl-core (youtube to mp3 api, play api?, avoid it all together?)
- Make promptEdit give suggestions and only allow suggestions (10 min)
- make one sound-pack per biome? (automatically remove biome from other soundpack when biome activated on new soundpack)(if a biome is not activated in any soundpack, that biome doesn't play anything for that sound)
- Solve why sound stops if running when switching day time
- make sounds trimmable (4h)
- make biomes weather probability (markhov chain?)
- make auto weather button that, when activated, changes the weather everytime the timeofday changes (and less likely change when place changes?)
- change Icon (10min)
- add wind intensity for weather (and minimal wind intensity to sounds in place soundlist)
- solving glitch problem
- solve all sounds problem
- add transition sound (with "transition" button):
    - long transition:  - with sound => footsteps (sounds depending on start place and arrival place)
                        - without sound
    - short transition: - with sound => (play arrival transition sound of arrival place (and departure sound of leaving place?))
                        - without sound
- for long transitions use stereo to fake things moving?
- clean everything by making classes instead of everything in one big dictionary
